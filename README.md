# Text Classification Project

This project focuses on text classification using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on a labeled dataset of text samples. The primary objectives are data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions on a test dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data/:** Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **results/:** Stores the trained model and any output files.
- **model_trainer.py:** Defines classes for training and saving a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
- **data_handler.py:** Defines classes for loading, preprocessing, and saving data.
- **main.py:** The main script for running the entire workflow.
